This project demonstrates a simple real-time messaging system using Apache Kafka and Spring Boot. 
It consists of two applications: Cab-Book-Driver, which acts as a producer sending driver location updates to a Kafka topic, and Cab-Book-User, which acts as a consumer receiving these updates in real-time.
The project is built with Java 17, uses Spring Boot for rapid development, and leverages Kafka for reliable, asynchronous communication between services. 
Itâ€™s a hands-on example of a producer-consumer architecture, showing how modular services can communicate efficiently through Kafka topics.
